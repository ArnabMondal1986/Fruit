Why do I need New Profile

The default Firefox profile is not very automation friendly. 
When you want to run automation reliably on a Firefox browser it is advisable to make a separate profile. 
Automation profile should be light to load and have special proxy and other settings to run good test.

You should be consistent with the profile you use on all development and test execution machines. 
If you used different profiles everywhere, the SSL certificates you accepted or the plug-ins you installed would be different and that would make the tests behave differently on the machines.

– There are several times when you need something special in your profile to make test execution reliable. 
The most common example is a SSL certificate settings or browser plug-ins that handles self-signed certs. 
It makes a lot of sense to create a profile that handles these special test needs and packaging and 
deploying it along with the test execution code.

– You should use a very lightweight profile with just the settings and plug-ins you need for the execution. 
Each time Selenium starts a new session driving a Firefox instance, it copies the entire profile in some temporary directory and 
if the profile is big, it makes it, not only slow but unreliable as well.

Example-

Below are main two example where we set preference according to needs.
Check package ssl and downloadingFiles for details.

1.Handling untrusted ssl certificate.We can set in firefox profile to accept the ssl certificate.
2.We can set preference that when we download a file it doesnot asks us whether we want want to "save file" or "cancel".
Rather it will download on its own without asking.
